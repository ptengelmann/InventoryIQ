# Analytics Impact Tracking - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ What's Been Built

You now have a complete **Impact Analytics** system for tracking AI recommendation performance!

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### **Route Structure**
- **OLD**: `/analytics` was the upload page ❌
- **NEW**:
  - `/upload` = CSV upload page ✅
  - `/analytics` = Impact tracking dashboard ✅

### **Navbar**
- Added "Upload" button (for CSV uploads)
- "Analytics" button now goes to impact tracking
- Order: Dashboard → Upload → Analytics → Intelligence → Alerts → History

---

## 🔌 API Endpoint

**Route**: `/api/analytics/performance`

**Query**: `GET /api/analytics/performance?userId=user@example.com`

**Returns**:
```json
{
  "stats": {
    "total_actions": 42,
    "total_expected_impact": 127500,
    "total_actual_impact": 115800,
    "success_rate": 85.2
  },
  "breakdown": [...],
  "recent_actions": [...]
}
```

---

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Navigate to dashboard**: http://localhost:3000/dashboard
2. **Click "Upload"** in navbar → Upload CSV
3. **Execute some actions** from dashboard/alerts
4. **Click "Analytics"** in navbar → See impact tracking

---

## 🎨 Database Fields Used

From the `Action` model:
- `expected_impact`: AI's £ prediction
- `actual_impact`: Real £ outcome (NULL until Shopify connected)
- `confidence_score`: AI confidence (0-1)
- `status`: pending/completed/failed
- `rollback_data`: Before/after comparison

---

## 🔮 Future: Automatic Impact Tracking (With Shopify)

Once Shopify is integrated, the system will:

1. **Capture Baseline**: Save current sales data before action
2. **Execute Action**: Change price/stock in Shopify
3. **Track Results**: Monitor sales for 7-30 days
4. **Calculate Impact**: Compare to baseline
5. **Update Database**: Set `actual_impact` field
6. **Show in Dashboard**: Display real vs predicted

**All automatic - zero manual work!**

---

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `/src/app/analytics/page.tsx` - Analytics dashboard
- `/src/app/api/analytics/performance/route.ts` - API endpoint

**Renamed:**
- `/src/app/analytics` → `/src/app/upload` (old upload page)

**Updated:**
- `/src/components/ui/navbar.tsx` - Added Upload button
- `/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Fixed routes
- `/src/app/history/page.tsx` - Fixed routes

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

### **Business Value:**
- Proves AI recommendations actually work
- Shows real ROI to customers/executives
- Builds trust through transparency
- Validates accuracy (target: 85-95%)

### **Competitive Edge:**
- Netstock doesn't track actual outcomes
- Most tools show predictions but never validate
- You close the loop and improve over time

### **Sales Pitch:**
> "Our AI predicted £127K revenue impact. We delivered £116K actual.
> That's 91% accuracy. Can your current system prove it works?"
