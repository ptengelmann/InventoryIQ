All suggestions should be in TypeScript and done step by step.

Changes should be done interactively, in TDD approach, wehre you create the test, run it in temrinal, see it fail, then implement the code to make it pass, run the test again and see it pass, while letting me know what is going on

All settings should be permanent, dependencies should be added to the configuration of the project and not only installed. They should be the latest versions whenever possible

Always propose the simplest and easier solution first, before going to more complex ones.
